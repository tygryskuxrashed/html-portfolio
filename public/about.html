<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Rashed Perez, a UI/UX Developer with a real passion for creating user-friendly, 
  visually appealing designs. I’ve worked on exciting projects, especially in SaaS, and I’m always 
  looking for new ways to grow my skills and bring fresh ideas to the table. If you’re in need of a 
  creative, reliable designer for part-time freelance projects, I’d love to collaborate! My focus is 
  on making sure your designs are not only beautiful but also easy to use, like your favorite app that
   you just can’t live without (we all have one, right?). Let’s team up and create something amazing 
   together that will really elevate your brand. Can’t wait to bring your ideas to life!</p>
